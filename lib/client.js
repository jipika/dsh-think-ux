/**
 * dsh-think-ux — DOM-layer Think-row UX + reader scroll intent.
 *
 * Upgrade-proof replacement for the first-generation bundle patches
 * (think-expand + autoscroll gesture guard):
 *
 *  1. Think rows auto-expand while their reasoning streams
 *     ([data-state="running"]) and auto-collapse when the row settles
 *     ([data-state="ok"]) — unless the reader toggled the row themselves,
 *     in which case the plugin never touches that row again. While
 *     auto-expanded, the body is a capped preview (at most 24 lines,
 *     top/bottom 24 px fades) that a rAF smooth-follower glides to the
 *     tail as text streams in — the "live preview" look instead of a
 *     full-height expansion. A reader scroll up inside the preview pauses
 *     the follow (resuming when they return to the bottom); a reader
 *     toggle lifts the cap (their expansion is full).
 *  2. Reader "reading up" intent suppresses the bundle's follow-to-bottom
 *     via a scrollTop write trap (defineProperty on the scroller). The
 *     bundle's re-pin is a plain JS assignment (el.scrollTop =
 *     el.scrollHeight); every reader input method (wheel, touch,
 *     scrollbar thumb, track click) scrolls natively and never passes
 *     through the JS setter. So a write that lands at the floor while
 *     the reader sits >25 px above it, inside the intent window, is the
 *     bundle's re-pin by construction: it is allowed to land (the
 *     bundle's own bookkeeping stays consistent) and the reader's
 *     position is restored in the same tick — the yank never paints,
 *     and the resulting scroll event makes the bundle's 500 ms sample
 *     heal atBottomRef=false. The reader's own return, in any event
 *     shape, is native and passes straight through: a downward arrival
 *     within 45 px of the floor ends the intent and actively bottoms
 *     out (the bundle's own bookkeeping only re-engages follow at 25
 *     px), and a click on the scroller's back-to-bottom button queues a
 *     one-shot pass for the jump the button performs.
 *  3. Turn-rail navigation glides: a click on the right rail's
 *     "load and jump to turn N" mark lands through the bundle's
 *     landOnRow write (el.scrollTop += flowTop(row) - 24), which snaps.
 *     A write from that writer targeting a middle row is swallowed and
 *     chased with the same episode machine as the bottom follow (fast
 *     exponential for big gaps, flat speed for small ones); the bundle's
 *     anchor-compensation corrections (a different writer) stay instant,
 *     reader input cancels a running glide, and every path that starts
 *     a floor episode (jump pass-through, re-pin swallow, re-follow
 *     arrival) clears the row target first. If a future bundle renames
 *     the writer the pattern stops matching and rail jumps fall back to
 *     the bundle's native snap (no breakage).
 *
 * Bundle internals relied on (0.1.5-rc.2):
 *  - Think row: [data-variant="think"][data-state][data-expanded]; its body
 *    UNMOUNTS when closed (DisclosureRow keeps no content by default), so the
 *    plugin toggles rows via a synthetic click on the [data-disclosure-row]
 *    element (expandOnRowClick) — React keeps owning the state.
 *  - Scroller: [data-conversation-scroll] (active-column host mode) or the
 *    nearest overflow-y:auto/scroll ancestor (view-local mode).
 *  - The bundle's follow re-pins via plain JS writes
 *    (el.scrollTop = el.scrollHeight in toBottom/followRef) from layout
 *    effects while atBottomRef is true; a reader move only disengages it
 *    after a 500 ms scroll-sample debounce. Native reader scrolling
 *    never passes through the JS property setter, so the trap can
 *    identify re-pins by construction.
 *
 * Globals: the runner's closure trap shadows bare `fetch` (the sink mirror
 * uses window.fetch). Timer globals (setTimeout/clearTimeout) ARE available
 * in the 0.1.5-rc.2 runner — the settle-collapse animation (COLLAPSE_MS)
 * uses them (verified at runtime); if a future runner withholds them, the
 * collapse self-degrades to the instant unmount (try/catch guard). Row
 * settling otherwise runs on MutationObserver + requestAnimationFrame;
 * plugin-vs-external toggles are told apart by the expected result recorded
 * around each synthetic click.

			 * The bundle's follow re-pin is a plain JS write
			 * (el.scrollTop = el.scrollHeight in toBottom/followRef).
			 * Native reader scrolling — wheel, touch, scrollbar thumb,
			 * track click — updates scrollTop inside the browser and
			 * never passes through the JS property setter. So a
			 * defineProperty trap on the scroller's scrollTop identifies
			 * the bundle's re-pin by construction: a write that lands
			 * within AT_BOTTOM_EPS of the floor while the reader sits
			 * more than AT_BOTTOM_EPS above it (inside the intent window)
			 * is a re-pin. It is allowed to land — so the bundle's own
			 * bookkeeping (observedTop, atBottomRef) stays consistent —
			 * and the reader's position is restored in the same tick.
			 * The real change fires a scroll event; the bundle's handler
			 * sees "reader moved", schedules its 500 ms sample, and
			 * flips atBottomRef=false — self-healing. Every reader
			 * return (any device, any event shape) is native, passes
			 * straight through, and re-engages the bundle's follow — a
			 * downward arrival within RE_FLOOR_EPS (45 px) of the floor
			 * ends the intent and actively bottoms out, so the bundle's
			 * own 25 px bookkeeping can re-engage its follow.
			 * Exceptions (re-pin-shaped writes LET THROUGH, intent ends):
			 * a NEW reader-initiated element appeared since arming (a
			 * durable user flow row, a pending-steering bubble
			 * [data-pending-steering], a submission echo
			 * [data-submission-echo]) — the bundle's "show me my
			 * message" jump; or a trusted click on the scroller's
			 * back-to-bottom button (the only <button> inside the
